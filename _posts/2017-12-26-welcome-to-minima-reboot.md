Welcome to `minima-reboot` a Bootstrap-based rewrite of `minima`, the base Jekyll theme. Check out the responsive navigation menu and footer by changing your browser's width. This is a post in the `_posts` directory. You can view `minima-reboot`'s source at: [minima-reboot](https://github.com/aterenin/minima-reboot). `minima-reboot` inherits Jekyll's support for code highlighting, as shown below.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
